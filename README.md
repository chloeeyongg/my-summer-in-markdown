# my-summer-in-markdown

## Introduction:
My name is Chloe Yong, I am a senior attending Chatsworth Charter High School in the G+STEAM Magnet Program. I am the president of the Mock Trial team here at Chatsworth and one of the captains of Model United Nations. I have two cats, one orange boy whos name is Nemo and a girl whos name is Junie. I am very new to computer science because when I took principles it was all self learning which made it difficult for me to understand. I hope to expand my knowledge of computer science this year!

## Summer Activities:
I went to the beach many times with different friends and we would swim, shop, and walk around. Another thing I did over the summer was intern at the LAUSD Region North district office.

## Most Memorable Experience:
During the summer I went on a mission trip with my church to Germany. We held a summer camp with Ukranian refugees and other teams from around the world. We also toured Berlin, the Czech Republic, and more.

## Summer Playlist 
Some of my favorite songs are 
- Transform by Daniel Caesar
- any song from Rex Orange County.
The reason why I love listening to Daniel Caesar's music is because it isn't sad but it has a very calm beat and its not too up beat. I like listenign Rex Orange County because he has many variations of music.

## Future Aspirations
In the future I plan on majoring in political science in order to become a lawyer. Over the summer, as I interned at the district office I learned from the Superintendent and other board members on public speaking and problem solving skills. These are all attributes I hope to use in the future.
